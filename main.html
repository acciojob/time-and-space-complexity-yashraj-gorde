    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. A good algorithm is one that is time-efficient and performs well even with large input sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory space required by an algorithm during its execution. An algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input size.
